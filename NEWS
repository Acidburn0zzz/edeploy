* Changes in eDeploy 1.5.0

*** Changes in eDeploy Build

- completed support for RHEL7 and CentOS7.

- expose the CODENAME_MAJOR and CODENAME_MINOR variables to reflect
  the major and minor version of a Linux distribution. For example,
  for CentOS 7.0.1406, CODENAME_MAJOR will be 7 and CODENAME_MINOR
  will be 0.

- all the git sha1 are stored in /usr/share/edeploy/<role>.rev to
  allow to trace back code revisions.

*** Changes in eDeploy Server

- implement multiple deployments on the same server described by
  multiple sections in /etc/edeploy.conf. The section name is passed
  as SECTION=<section> in the linux kernel parameters on PXE boots.

- improved logging in the CGI script to allow to follow what is
  happening by remote server: IP address, time of action, PID of the
  script to follow parallel installations, more meaningful messages.

*** Changes in eDeploy Automatic Health Check
